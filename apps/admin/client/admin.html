          What could someone be able to administer?
        </p>
        <p>
          Any group that they are "admin" or above on - and any system account
        </p>
        <p>
          The system data of any user account that is a member of a group they are admin or above on
        </p>
        <p>
          For accounts with global roles, anything, if their global role is admin or above (except their own global role)
        </p>
        <p>
          Also certain users in certain groups may have control over some functionalities - or should they stay within the app code?
          e.g. edit and publish roles should be able to do certain things within certain system accounts...

          oabutton example

        <p>
          Consider an oabutton user comes to the admin page. If just a user, access denied. But if admin or above, has controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Show all users in the oabutton group, and allow to extract info about them, and ban them from the group?
        </p>
        <p>
          Add CL users not already in the oabutton group to the group? Arbitrarily, or only if the user asked to join? (group join requests)
        </p>
        <p>
          Show OAB_Blocked, OAB_Wishlist, OAB_DNR, OAB_Request, and allow to edit them and change their values?
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow followup of requests
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow exploration and extraction of OAB data and certain user data
        </p>
