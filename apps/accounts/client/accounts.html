      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <p>
        Profile options here to set or change username (defaults to first email address so that is used in public places).
        For setting or changing username, a check for uniqueness is required.
        Also add a bio, URL to profile picture, and any other profile data the user should be able to add and manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users should also be able to add email addresses to the account, and set which email is the default one.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Permissions</h3>
      <p>
        Show the groups and roles the user is part of. Link groups that are about services we run to those running services, 
        so that they can be easily navigated to? Provide options to remove self from role and to request access to role?
        Also could create a group for this user, where roles could be delegated to other users within this user group, so that 
        responsibility of this user becomes available to multiple other users (turns this account into an "org" account).
        So also search for and list user accounts that are in the group that matches this user ID, and the roles they have in 
        that group, so this user can review the other users that have access to their account.
      </p>

        {{#each rn in rolenames}}
        {{rn}}<br>
        {{/each}}        
      </p>
      
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually provide two-factor signin. Also provide log of user login activity / status data.
        Option to login on only one device or mutliple (controlled by setPassword call on server, whether logout option is true or not).
        Options to logout of "all devices" / "all places". Disable / delete account.
        Can also do device fingerprinting with https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2
      </p>
      
      <h3>API</h3>
      <p>
        The Cottage Labs API is at https://api.cottagelabs.com and provides various features depending on membership 
        of certain groups. Using the API requires authentication with the account ID and API key, shown below. The 
        API docs explains more, and how to use the ID and API key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Account ID {{currentUser._id}}
      </p>
      <p>
        API key {{defaultapikey}}
      </p>
      <p>
        Could allow for multiple API keys per account, and re-generation of API key.
