        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Profile options here to set or change username (defaults to first email address so that is used in public places).
          For setting or changing username, a check for uniqueness is required.
          Also add a bio, URL to profile picture, and any other profile data the user should be able to add and manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users should also be able to add email addresses to the account, and set which email is the default one.
        </p>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <p>
          Show the groups and roles the user is part of. Link groups that are about services we run to those running services, 
          so that they can be easily navigated to? Provide options to remove self from role and to request access to role?
          Also could create a group for this user, where roles could be delegated to other users within this user group, so that 
          responsibility of this user becomes available to multiple other users (turns this account into an "org" account).
          So also search for and list user accounts that are in the group that matches this user ID, and the roles they have in 
          that group, so this user can review the other users that have access to their account.
        </p>

          {{#each rn in rolenames}}

        <h3>Security</h3>
        {{#if currentUser.security.regdevice}}
        {{#if session "logincode"}}
        <p>
          Login code {{session "logincode"}} is currently available for use.
        </p>
        {{/if}}
        <p>
          You have a registered device with ID {{currentUser.security.regdevice}}
        </p>
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-block" href="#" id="unregdevice">Unregister this device</a></p>
        {{else}}
        <p>
          You can register one device to your account for security purposes.
          Do you want to register this device to your account? If you do, you will be able to login from this device, 
          by capturing the qr code displayed on the login page with the camera of this device.
        </p>
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-block" href="#" id="regdevice">Register this device</a></p>
        {{/if}}
        <p>
          Eventually provide two-factor signin. Also provide log of user login activity / status data.
          Option to login on only one device or mutliple (controlled by setPassword call on server, whether logout option is true or not).
          Options to logout of "all devices" / "all places". Disable / delete account.
          Can also do device fingerprinting with https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2.
          Also have option if settings have API_AUTH_BY_COOKIE_KEY then user can choose if their cookies should be httponly or not
          If they are not then they can be conveniently picked up to authenticate API requests from the browser 
          but that also allows XSS. So if they are httponly then the user has more security but can ONLY auth to the API using the ID and API key.
          Also can have an option to use device fingerprinting, in which case collect a fingerprint from this accounts page and store it. Then 
          on cookie login or other methods done via web UI, can capture device fingerprint (but of course this only works per device, and can cause 
          login to become invalid, e.g. if user device / browser / etc is updated or upgraded in certain ways. So provides more security for extra 
          potential hassle.)
          A user could also choose how long they want their cookie to last for?
        </p>

        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>
          The Cottage Labs API is at https://api.cottagelabs.com and provides various features depending on membership 
          of certain groups. Using the API requires authentication with the account ID and API key, shown below. The 
          API docs explains more, and how to use the ID and API key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Account ID {{currentUser._id}}
        </p>
        <p>
          API key {{defaultapikey}}
        </p>
        <p>
          Could allow for multiple API keys per account, and re-generation of API key.
