        "abstract": "Proactive coping, directed at an upcoming as opposed to an ongoing stressor, is a new focus in 
        positive psychology research. However, two differing conceptualizations of this construct create confusion. 
        This study compared how each operationalization of proactive coping relates to well-being. Participants (N = 281) 
        facing an upcoming college examination completed the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI; consisting of two subscales 
        that each assess one of the conceptualizations), the Proactive Competence Scale (PCS; that assesses the proactive 
        coping process), and measures of well-being. The results demonstrated that conceptualizing proactive coping as a 
        positively-focused striving for goals was predictive of well-being (the shared variance from affect, subjective 
        well-being and physical symptoms), whereas conceptualizing proactive coping as focused on preventing a negative 
        future was not. The first conceptualization of proactive copingâ€™s unique association with well-being was explained 
        by two of the proactive competencies, use of resources and realistic goal setting, and the remaining variance in 
        well-being was explained by the first factor of optimism. These results demonstrated that aspiring for a positive 
        future is distinctly predictive of well-being and that research should focus on accumulating resources and goal 
        setting in designing interventions to promote proactive coping.",

Metadata format

Most fields are self-explanatory, here is a quick description of the other ones:

pdf_url is the URL where dissemin thinks the full text can be accessed for free. 
This is rarely a direct link to an actual PDF file. It is set to null if we could not find a free source for this paper.

publications gives a list of the places where this paper has been published (so: journals, conferences), and the associated bibliographical metadata. 
If the publisher has been found in RoMEO, it also indicates the summary of its policy, using the codes drawn from the RoMEO API.
records gives a list of the places where the full text has been made available (so: repositories, homepages or social networks). 
Sometimes, these repositories only contain a bibliographical record and not the full text. The pdf_url field of each record indicates 
our assessment of the availability of that record.
