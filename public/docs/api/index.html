        <h3>API data structure</h3>
        <p>
          This API returns (and in some places accepts) JSON. Unless otherwise specified, the JSON data structure returned will be a JSON 
          object with a <b>status</b> key describing how the API behaved with respect to the request. Any response 
          data will be in the <b>data</b> key. Any messages will appear in the <b>message</b> key. API endpoints 
          below will describe any other information they return, and will specify if they differ from this convention.
        </p>

        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          Sign up for a Cottage Labs account at <a target="_blank" href="http://accounts.cottagelabs.com">http://accounts.cottagelabs.com</a>. 
          Once signed up, view your account details page to see your user ID and your API key. <span id="signedupalready"></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          COMING SOON: have multiple API keys and generate new ones as required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have these credentials, they can be used to authenticate against any API route. Provide them 
          either as headers in your request, using header names <b>x-id</b> and <b>x-apikey</b> or include them 
          as URL query string parameters named <b>id</b> and <b>apikey</b>. For convenience, the URL query parameters 
          can also accept <b>email</b> or <b>username</b> instead of <b>id</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that whilst this gives you the ability to authenticate, API endpoints will also enfore authorisation 
          restrictions using roles and groups.
        </p>

        <h3>Authorisation</h3>
        <p>
          After authentication, authorisation to perform certain actions is controlled by membership of roles and groups. 
          The Cottage Labs accounts API (detailed below) provides routes for controlling membership of roles and groups. 
          External services that use the Cottage Labs accounts API can customise the roles and groups that are used, but 
          the conventional usage is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a default set of cascading roles - e.g. <b>root</b> is most senior, and is senior 
          to all those following it. If any of these roles are used, then authorisation checks will take cascading 
          seniority into account. Therefore, any user account with the <b>owner</b> role will be authorised whenever 
          the <b>owner</b> role is checked for, but ALSO whenever the <b>auth</b> role is checked for, or any other role 
          that comes after it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>root</b> roles should not generally be used, and should only be created by server administrators</li>
          <li><b>system</b> roles denote system accounts, useful for where external services make use of the accounts 
            API and need to manage users for that external services</li>
          <li><b>super</b> roles should denote administrators with full control of a given system</li>
          <li><b>owner</b> roles should identify a contactable owner, and preferably be unique but not necessarily</li>
          <li><b>auth</b> roles have full control as owners, but are not expected to be contactable</li>
          <li><b>admin</b> roles means admin access to some set of admin features of the system in question, rather 
            than control of the whole system</li>
          <li><b>publish</b></li>
          <li><b>edit</b></li>
          <li><b>read</b></li>
          <li><b>info</b></li>
          <li><b>public</b></li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Accounts API</h2>

        <h3>/accounts</h3>
        <p>
          GET a list of all user account IDs.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/count</h3>
        <p>
          GET a count of all user accounts.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/online</h3>
        <p>
          GET a list of user IDs and count of all user accounts that appear to be online.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/online/count</h3>
        <p>
          GET just the count of how many user accounts appear to be online.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id</h3>
        <p>
          GET the user account identified by the :id parameter (can be user ID, email address, or username).
          To the user of the queried account it returns the profile, roles, username, and emails. To system 
          accounts it also returns the related system data.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/status</h3>
        <p>
          GET the current status of the account - is it online, is it idle.
        </p>
        <p>
          POST to this endpoint provides a way for external systems to indicate that the user is online and not idle. 
          Keeps the online status of the user up to date when they are using external systems.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/profile</h3>
        <p>
          POST updates to the profile of the user. Partially updates the user profile with the data provided, but leaves 
          other profile data intact. Accessible to the user of the account itself, or anyone delegated control over that 
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          PUT works as above but replaces the entire user profile with the provided data, overwriting anything that was 
          previously in the profile.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/system/:sys</h3>
        <p>
          POST and PUT similiarly to the above profile endpoint, but updates the relevant system section of the user account, 
          and is authorised for the user that has relevant permissions for said system - NOT authorised for the user account owner.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/roles/:group.role</h3>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/auth/:roles</h3>
        <p>
          GET with a comma-separated list of grouproles, and returns whether or not the user has the necessary authority.
          Return data will indicate false if not, or else the name of the first grouprole that the user has permission on.
        </p>

        <h3>/accounts/:id/request/:role</h3>
